Homework 2

The purpose of this program is to perform various functions on a matrix, including adding and subtracting.
The transpose function was added for the purpose of the assignment, which swaps elements of the matrix
with the opposite element.

Example output:

Matrix a:
1	2
3	4

Transpose of a:
1	3
2	4

Additionally, code was added to return integer values for elements of the matrix.

In order to use the makefile, use either "make test_static" or "make test_dynamic".
Output is generated in the output_static file or output_dynamic file.
